# How to set up on local machine

## Pre-setup

Create a new folder anywhere on your system
open terminal in this new folder.

## Setup

1. The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/chetan6780/Auctions.git
$ cd Auctions
```

2. Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
```

    for linux

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
```

3. install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Note: `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv`.
For pipenv you will not see any `(env)` in front of the propt._

4. Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ python manage.py makemigrations
(env)$ python manage.py migrate
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

The application should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
